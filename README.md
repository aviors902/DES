# DES Encryption - COMP3260 A2

This is the README for the DES implementation created for COMP3260's second assignment, as implmented by Mattieu Guisard & Jaret Posner

## Execution

### Encryption

1. Open up a terminal in the directory of the proram
2. Input the directory to a file you want to encrypt as an argument for the program `./main.py encryptme.txt` for example.
3. Wait for the program to encrypt your file.
4. The output will be displayed in the console window.

### Decryption

1. Open up a terminal in the directory of the proram
2. Input the directory to a file you want to decrypt as the first argument for the program, adding in the -d flag before the file you want to decrypt `./main.py -d decryptme.txt` for example
3. Wait for the program to decrypt your file.
4. The output will be displayed in the console window.
