# DES Encryption - COMP3260 A2

This is the README for the DES implementation created for COMP3260's second assignment, as implmented by Mathieu Guisard & Jaret Posner

## Execution

Start the program using python3.
Both DESEncryption and DESDecryption will ask you for a file. Use full FilePaths.
The input file should be .txt format, laid out in the same way as the sample text files.

Decryption needs line 1 and 2 to contain 64-bit blocks of binary plaintext to be encrypted
Line 3 and 4 are 2 encryption keys to be used in the processes

Results of the avalance effect will be put into an output file, and the filepath will be the process used, followed by the date and time the program was run

DESEncryption performs encryption and DESDecryption performs decryption.
